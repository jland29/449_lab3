## Our New Spacecraft
{% author 'John' 'Landers' %}
It's finally here, everybody! Yesterday we just received our newest spacecraft that will allow us to travel farther away and at faster speeds on every trip! This is a big 
step forward for our exploration team, as we are now able to explore thousands more planets and stars! Thank you all for sticking with our blog and supporting us!
