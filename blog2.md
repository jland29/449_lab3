## Did We Just Discover a New Element?
{% author 'John' 'Landers' %}
<p>Folks, we may need to finally updat ethe periodic table of elements!</p>
<p>On a recent trip to Kepler 513-B within our Milky Way Galaxy, we discovered a very interesting substance on the surface. This substance was very thick feeling, and 
reacted very explosively when coming into contact with water. While we cannot confirm yet that we have 100% found a new element, we have never seen anything like this here on
Earth, and think we may have a huge discovery that requires an addition to the perioc table!<p>
