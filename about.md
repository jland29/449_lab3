## About our blog
Our blog began over 8 years ago as we began exploring various new areas of our galaxy. We discovered a lot of things and wanted to share these findings with 
the world! Our passion for writing has only grown ever since starting this blog, and we love being able to find something interesting, write about it, and interact 
with all of our fellow readers after to discuss and learn more! We will continue to invest ourselves in unique findings and interesting stories!
